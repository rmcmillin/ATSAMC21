# ATSAMC21
Simple ATSAMC21 Peripheral Drivers<br>
Breadboard compatible breakout board with UART - USB tranceiver<br>
<br>
# About this Project
This is a mostly abandoned project.  The breakout board works and has minimal features - 32Mhz crystal, 32.768khz crystal, reset button, UART to USB tranciever with blinking LEDs on Tx/Rx, programmer header for the atmel ICE programmer.<br>
<br>
Code is 'as-is'.  It works, but not beautified. It's possible there is a bug or two.  The delay functions were added to simplify the code - a timer should be used instead.
